Remove the Wand items that place blocks and just have the blocks be craftable holy shit why even bother making a Bone Wand and then mining the placed bones gives you Bone Blocks just have the blocks themselves
Crafting recipes would be as simple as
Wood > Living Wood Block
Wood > Living Leaf Block
Rich Mahogany > Living Mahogany Block
Rich Mahogany > Living Mahogany Leaf Block
Bone > Bone Block


Remove light given off by teleporters
